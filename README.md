# Guess the Sequence Game
Introduction
An number sequence guessing terminal-game made in Rust.
This is a simple game where the player needs to guess a sequence of numbers generated randomly by the computer. The sequence consists of a set of numbers that are multiples of a randomly generated first number, followed by a final number that is a multiple of a different randomly generated number.

How to Play
  1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
  2. Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine.
  3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
  4. Type cargo run and press Enter to run the game.
  5. The game will display a prompt asking you to enter your guess. The sequence consists of 5 numbers in total.
  6. Enter your guess as a comma-separated list of numbers. For example, if you think the sequence is 2,4,6,8,10, enter "2,4,6,8,10" and press Enter.
  7. If your guess is correct, the game will display a message congratulating you and end.
  8. If your guess is incorrect, the game will display a message informing you that you have an incorrect guess and ask you to try again.
  9. You have 5 guesses to try and get the correct sequence. If you run out of guesses before guessing the correct sequence, the game will display a message telling you that you are out of guesses and show you the correct sequence.
